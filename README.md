## Mobile Flashcards

## Project Overview

Mobile Flashcards is the third project in the Udacity React Nanodegree. It is designed to teach students how to create a React Native application.

The application allows the user to create decks of flashcards for study. 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app).

The project has been tested on Android.

### Installation

First, you need to clone this file to your local machine, which you can do by running the command:
### `git clone https://github.com/markyz89/mobile-flashcards.git`

You should then run 
### `npm install` 
to install the project's dependencies.

Once installed, to start the application, you can run:

### `expo start`

Which runs the app in the development mode.<br />
You can use the Expo mobile application to view it on a physical device, or install Android Studio to create an emulator to run it on.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Usage

The home screen shows a list of default cards asking questions on JavaScript and React. The user can create their own deck by clicking on Deck Create in the tab in the bottom right of the application.

The user can add questions to any deck by clicking on the deck's name in the Deck List view and then clicking Add Card. Beneath the Add Card option is the option to start a quiz.

The quiz is self assessed. You will be presented with a question and will have to answer whether you got the question right or wrong. You can check your answer by pressing Reveal Answer to reveal the answer.

Once you have completed the quiz, your score will be shown. You can then opt to retake the quiz or go back to the deck view.
